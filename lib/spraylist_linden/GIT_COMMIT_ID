The code in this folder is based on the SprayList code with commit id
e6c851d93156646efa4ce0a9dbdb2e1a3e8d3693 (*) but contains a patch that
improves memory handling for the SprayList.

Without the patch it is only possible to specify how much memory each
thread will be able to allocate. This is problematic for the single
source shortest paths benchmark as it makes it impossible to run the
benchmark with a single thread and many threads using the same
binary. The benchmark would either run out of memory when a single
thread is used or there would not be enough memory on the machine when
many threads are used.

With the patch one can specify how much memory all threads can
allocated together (the #define SSALLOC_SIZE_ALL in
include/ssalloc.h). The patch makes sure that this amount of memory is
divided between the threads (Note that the global variable
number_of_threads has to be set to the correct value for this to
work).
